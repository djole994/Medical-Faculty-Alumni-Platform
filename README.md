# 🎓 Medical Faculty Alumni Platform

A centralized digital platform connecting students and graduates of the Medical Faculty.

This project is currently under active development as a modern solution for the Alumni community, aimed at enabling former students to stay connected, track scientific events, and share professional opportunities.

## 📖 About the Project

The Alumni Platform transforms how the Medical Faculty interacts with its graduates.  
Replacing outdated lists and manual workflows, the application provides a modern, interactive experience where users can:

- ✅ Create professional profiles and become **verified members** of the organization  
- 🌍 Visualize global Alumni presence via an **interactive world map**  
- 🗓️ Register online for **congresses and educational events**  
- 💼 Access an exclusive **job board** and read inspiring **Alumni Stories**  
- 💳 View financial reports and subscription statuses (Administrative Dashboard). **financial module**  
- ⚙️ Benefit from automation (**geolocation, verification**) and scalability (**data caching**)

## 🚀 Key Challenges & Solutions

### 1. Intelligent Geocoding & Hybrid Caching

One of the primary engineering goals was to map users worldwide accurately without overloading external APIs, while still handling typos and imperfect data entry gracefully.

To solve this, I implemented a **Hybrid Caching Strategy** with smart fallback logic:

1. **Check the local `GeoCache`** first (Layer 1) to prevent redundant API calls.
2. If missing, request coordinates from **Nominatim API** (Layer 2).
3. If the API can’t resolve the city (e.g., due to a typo), the system:
   - Automatically falls back to **Country center coordinates**.
   - Flags the profile for **manual admin verification**.

> **Impact:** This approach reduced external API calls by approx. 80% during testing and prevents the "empty map" issue for users with misspelled cities.

## 📌 Notes
- External APIs are protected from abuse via caching and fallback rules.
- Failed/uncertain locations are never silently accepted—they’re tracked for admin verification.
